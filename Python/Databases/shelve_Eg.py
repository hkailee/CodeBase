"""
Not much of a new topic compared to dbm and pickle earlier, simply a combination
of the DBM files and object pickling, but with several advantage for big dataset
(i.e. Analogy of a shelf storing multiple DBM files indexed by keys for retrieval):
1. To store an in-memory object by key, the shelve module first serializes the
object to a string with the pickle module, and then it stores that string in a
DBM file by key with the dbm module.
2.To fetch an object back by key, the shelve module first loads the objectâ€™s
serialized string by key from a DBM file with the dbm module, and then converts
it back to the original in-memory object with the pickle module.
